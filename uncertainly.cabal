Synopsis:            Uncertainty propagation of values such as physical measurements or approximate computations
Description:         A library for dealing with values that are known not exactly but
                     only to some roughly known precision, because obtaining the exact value is
                     impossible or at least infeasible and perhaps not necessary.
                     It is nontrivial to see how the errors in such quantities propagate through
                     further computations; this library provides a functor interface that
                     allows \"embedding\" of any such computations into the uncertainty-range.
